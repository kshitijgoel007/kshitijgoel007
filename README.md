I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Robotics Institute (RI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I work at the
Resilient Intelligent Systems Lab (RISLab) with Wennie Tabib and Nathan Michael. Previously, I completed my
Masters in Robotics with Nathan Michael at RI, CMU and undergraduate studies in Aerospace Engineering from the
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. I was advised by Manoranjan Sinha for my undergraduate thesis.

I am interested in creating teams of robots that can adapt their agency with environmental complexity while
operating near their sensing, compute, and physical limits.
