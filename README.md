I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Robotics Institute (RI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am advised by Wennie
Tabib (Systems Scientist, CMU). Previously, I completed my Masters in Robotics with Nathan Michael (CTO, Shield AI)
at RI, CMU. Earlier, I was an undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology
(IIT) Kharagpur.

I am interested in creating teams of robots that can adapt their agency with environmental complexity while
operating near their sensing, compute, and physical limits.

I program robots using C, C++, CUDA C, Python, and Rust.
